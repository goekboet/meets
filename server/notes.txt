- Implement paging by timewindow

the call to host/{hostname}/meets can contain a query-string in the format:

(:- default)
from={unix-timestamp :- now}&for={minutes :- 60}

this returns any meets for that host that begins within the time that falls within the window.

we want to use this to implement a weekly calendar in the ISO-format on the client to page through meets
by week-number.

- get the unix timestamp of the start of an arbitrary ISOWeek
- get the time in minutes to start of next week.
